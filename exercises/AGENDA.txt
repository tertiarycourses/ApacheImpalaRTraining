Apache Impala is an open source massively parallel processing SQL query engine for Apache Hadoop.
The result is order-of-magnitude faster performance than Hive, depending on the type of query and configuration. Apache Impala provides a familiar and unified platform for batch-oriented or real-time queries. This course shows how to use R tidyverse package and Impala to query, visualize and perform statistical analysis & machine learning on your data.
